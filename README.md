# ðŸ§  Deep Research Multi-Agent System

A multi-agent research assistant powered by LLMs (Gemini) using OpenAISDK  
It takes a userâ€™s query, plans research tasks, performs web searches, synthesizes results, validates sources, and generates a polished **professional research report with citations**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ core.py # Central configuration & shared context (merged config + shared)
â”œâ”€â”€ deep_research_agent.py # Entry point (user interaction + pipeline execution)
â”œâ”€â”€ planning_agent.py # Breaks clarified query into specific research tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ research_agents.py # Web search, reflection, citations, source checking, orchestrator
â”œâ”€â”€ synthesis_agent.py # Synthesizes findings into a structured draft
â”œâ”€â”€ report_writer.py # Finalizes professional report and saves to file
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/ # Auto-generated research reports

dependencies are in pyproject.toml

3. Configure Environment

Create a .env file in the root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here # for tracing
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

Run the entry point:

uv run deep_research_system.py 

Flow:

1. Requirement Gathering Agent
    Clarifies the userâ€™s query (scope, depth).

2. Planning Agent
    Breaks query into 2â€“3 sub-tasks.

3. Orchestrator Agent
    Coordinates research:

        Web Search Agent â†’ Reflective Agent â†’ Synthesis Agent
        Citations Agent â†’ Source Checker Agent â†’ Report Writer Agent

4. Report Writer Agent
    Produces a polished research report with APA citations and saves it to reports/.

ðŸ§© Agents Overview

Requirement Gathering Agent â†’ clarifies the initial query.

Planning Agent â†’ breaks query into research tasks.

Web Search Agent â†’ executes searches and stores results.

Reflective Agent â†’ reviews results, identifies themes.

Synthesis Agent â†’ creates a cohesive draft with inline citations.

Citations Agent â†’ inserts citation markers [1], [2].

Source Checker Agent â†’ validates sources and formats APA references.

Report Writer Agent â†’ compiles everything into the final report.




ðŸ“Œ Notes

The pipeline is asynchronous (asyncio) for efficiency.

All agents share context through LocalContext.

Reports are timestamped and stored under reports/.

Easily extendable with new agents (e.g., visualization, data analysis).



ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Export final report as Word (.docx) or PDF automatically.

Add fact-checking agent using retrieval-augmented generation.

Support custom report templates (academic, business, policy briefs).
