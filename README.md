# 🧠 Deep Research Multi-Agent System

A multi-agent research assistant powered by LLMs (Gemini) using OpenAISDK  
It takes a user’s query, plans research tasks, performs web searches, synthesizes results, validates sources, and generates a polished **professional research report with citations**.

## 📂 Project Structure

├── core.py # Central configuration & shared context (merged config + shared)
├── deep_research_agent.py # Entry point (user interaction + pipeline execution)
├── planning_agent.py # Breaks clarified query into specific research tasks
├── research_agents.py # Web search, reflection, citations, source checking, orchestrator
├── synthesis_agent.py # Synthesizes findings into a structured draft
├── report_writer.py # Finalizes professional report and saves to file
├── reports/ # Auto-generated research reports

dependencies are in pyproject.toml

3. Configure Environment

Create a .env file in the root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here # for tracing
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

Run the entry point:

uv run deep_research_system.py 

Flow:

1. Requirement Gathering Agent
    Clarifies the user’s query (scope, depth).

2. Planning Agent
    Breaks query into 2–3 sub-tasks.

3. Orchestrator Agent
    Coordinates research:

        Web Search Agent → Reflective Agent → Synthesis Agent
        Citations Agent → Source Checker Agent → Report Writer Agent

4. Report Writer Agent
    Produces a polished research report with APA citations and saves it to reports/.

🧩 Agents Overview

Requirement Gathering Agent → clarifies the initial query.

Planning Agent → breaks query into research tasks.

Web Search Agent → executes searches and stores results.

Reflective Agent → reviews results, identifies themes.

Synthesis Agent → creates a cohesive draft with inline citations.

Citations Agent → inserts citation markers [1], [2].

Source Checker Agent → validates sources and formats APA references.

Report Writer Agent → compiles everything into the final report.




📌 Notes

The pipeline is asynchronous (asyncio) for efficiency.

All agents share context through LocalContext.

Reports are timestamped and stored under reports/.

Easily extendable with new agents (e.g., visualization, data analysis).



🔮 Future Improvements

Export final report as Word (.docx) or PDF automatically.

Add fact-checking agent using retrieval-augmented generation.

Support custom report templates (academic, business, policy briefs).
